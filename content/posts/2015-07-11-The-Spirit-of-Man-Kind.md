Title: The Spirit of Man Kind
Tags: posts

I'm currently reading [The First Men in the Moon](https://www.amazon.ca/HG-
Wells-Classic-
Collection-I/dp/0575095202),
by H. G. Wells. If you're not into Science Fiction, any of his books will
change your mind (the book I've linked contains 5 of his best books including
the aforementioned) - Wells paints elaborate pictures in your mind that make
any fictional notion seem as real as life itself.



One passage in this book caught my attention. It captured humanity's urge to
venture into the unexplored in beautiful prose, so I thought I'd share.



>Why had we come to the moon? The thing presented itself to me as a perplexing
problem. What is this spirit in man that urges him for ever to depart from
happiness and security, to toil, to place himself in danger, to risk even a
reasonable certainty of death? It dawned upon me that there in the moon as a
thing I ought always to have known, that man is not made simply to go about
being safe and comfortable and well fed and amused. Almost any man, if you put
the thing to him, not in words, but in the shape of opportunities, will show
that he knows as much. Against his interest, against his happiness, he is
constantly being driven to do unreasonable things. Some force not himself
impels him, and go he must.
