Title: Mentally Exhausted
Tags: music post format audio

I've been running on very little sleep, and my mental gas tank is near empty.
Add a mild hangover to the mix and voila; the ultimate writer's block.



So I won't waste your time here with something that might come out looking
like a half-hearted attempt at a good post. I am, however, dedicated to
posting every other day in order to maintain this schedule I've had going.
Besides, the calendar on the side just wouldn't look right if the alternating
pattern of bold and regular text seized to continue.



I'll leave you with a nice catchy song as a thank you for reading today's
post.
