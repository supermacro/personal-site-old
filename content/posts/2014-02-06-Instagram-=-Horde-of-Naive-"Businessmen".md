Title: Instagram = Horde of Naive "Businessmen"

Tags: posts



I've been trying to remember an accountholder's username in order to post
this. Well, today my good-ol' brain decided to retrieve this great bit of
info.



Two months back I had [another](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/survivorship-bias-
other-cool-stuff.html "Survivorship Bias & Other Cool Stuff") argument, but
this time it was on Instagram. It all began with this "inspiring" comment by
the account holder:

Yes, my phone is in spanish ... I Need All The Practice I Can Get



Now, I'm not here to say that I know anything about investing, because I
really don't. However, this is just insane.



I followed up with this reply:

> If you don't have skin in the game (i.e. you haven't sold shit, generated
revenue, or incurred costs) what makes you think that investors will be
willing to throw money at an unproven business model based on simple theory. A
business model isn't enough to impress an investor, its got to have been
tested. That's why past sales are important. They serve as a proxy measure for
future potential. So I do think someone forking over millions of dollars cares
about past performance [especially] of a highly volatile startup company.

Soon afterwards I was barraged with comments from "knowledgeable"
Instagrammers, but lets not digress.



Put yourself in the shoes of a millionaire who's listening in on a hot-shot
young boy who thinks he's got the world figured out. Not only does he believe
he will revolutionize the world, he's so confident that he hasn't tested the
idea himself, and is now asking for a large sum of money for a percentage of
the imaginary firm. The only assurance the millionaire investor has in knowing
that this venture will reap any reward is a child's word, which is of little
value irregardless of how good his business plan may be.



In my eyes, investors such as these want good management. To have good
management you must have proven yourself under strenuous circumstances. And
without past sales, what kind of strenuous circumstances has one faced?
Secondly, investors will probably be looking for consistency in past sales. A
large spike in sales from a one-time contract won't impress anyone, you need a
model that can coast and has substantially more upside than downside.



Unless you're [Julian Marchese](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcB0L6ANMkQ),
you will undoubtedly fail amongst the Sharks and Dragons when you pitch an
imaginary idea with self perceived lucrative potential.



Then again, I'm just a kid myself who knows next to nothing.
