Title: The Age Of Joblessness
Tags: posts

Haven't been feeling too well as of late. Add a final exam coming up and the
result is a squeezed-out blog post. I do, however, intend on writing every
other day for the rest of my internship. I've got exciting things coming down
the pipeline which will most likely change my blogging schedule, and perhaps
even the outlet from which I publish my writing.



Anyways, I recently wrote about [automation in our
lives](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/automation-is-nigh.html "Automation Is Nigh")
\- one of my favorite posts might I add. There is very little one can predict
with confidence but I'm undoubtedly sure that as society progresses, so too
will the capabilities of artificial intelligence. So much so that we will
eventually be competing for jobs with robots. Here's an excerpt from the
[Bloomberg post](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-17/how-to-keep-your-
job-when-you-re-boss-is-a-robot.html) that inspired me to return to this
subject:

> The dividing line between what's routine and what's not is shifting. When
the 2003 study was published, truck driving and medical diagnosis fell clearly
into the non-routine category. That's no longer the case. According to the
[Oxford study](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/your-job-taught-to-
machines-puts-half-u-s-work-at-risk.html), taxi drivers and chauffeurs are now
among the most at-risk positions, facing an 89 percent probability of becoming
automatable. (Considering that Google's fully autonomous cars have already
clocked more than half a million test miles, 89 percent may be lowballing it.)
Similarly, in health care, IBM's powerful artificial intelligence machine,
dubbed Watson, is already getting paid to [dispense
advice](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2014/01/09/brainy-
watson-computer-to-tackle-cancer-and-other-medical-research/) on complex
medical treatment decisions.

How do you keep up?



**Be As Human As Possible:**



The Bloomberg article suggests that the least at-risk roles to be replaced are
those that require as little routine as possible. Artistic directors, poets,
scientific researches, and managers all require judgement based on extenuating
circumstances that artificial intelligence can't [yet] do. Typical middle
income jobs, which sadly contain much routine, are going to slowly disappear
as robots begin to do our work more efficiently. Even I have been slightly
guilty at my internship of planting the seeds of unemployment by automating
some of my tasks through
[VBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications).



**Learn To Live Amongst The Robots:**



In this increasingly technological society there will be those who can
automate and those who can't. I truly believe that the more you understand
technology, and the better you are at understanding the inner workings of
artificial intelligence, the more exempt you are from the trend in middle
income job loss. My advice is to start learning more about technology and how
it could impact you.



Perhaps you want to learn how to code, or understand hardware. There's an
insane abundance of free material online from which to learn from. Whatever it
is, try to expand your horizons, you may just be one of the millions who've
already created their own jobs.
