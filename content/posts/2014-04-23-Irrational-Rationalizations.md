Title: Irrational Rationalizations
Tags: forty-eight

A friend of mine constantly battles with himself and his inability to break
bad habits. On the one hand, he knows that every breath he takes through the
filter of a cigarette is another nail in the coffin. He's more than well aware
of the negative repercussions that come about with smoking. Ironically, and
under the complete awareness that smoking will kill him, he cannot get enough
of it.



So here lies an example of [cognitive
dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) \- the mental
divide caused by opposing thoughts which pull at your sanity. One would surely
go mental if we did not do something about this polarization of the mind.
Thankfully, we as somewhat logical beings seek one of the two following
solutions to this mental anguish. You could try and change those negative
habits in your life, or you could rationalize the seemingly unsurmountable
flaw in order to maintain any shred of sanity that may still remain when you
realize that you're still causing harm to yourself.



The latter is typically what we tend to do, but the goal is to try and be
better than that. Most people will seek [confirmatory
evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) in the hope of
rationalizing their misguided actions, all in the hope of continuing what they
internally know as something they shouldn't be doing.



Self-awareness is a rare trait amongst people, but an essential one if you are
truly seeking to improve yourself. Once you see your flaws for what they truly
are, then you can begin to accept that you, like every single human on this
earth, are not perfect.



Don't shroud yourself in conscious self-deceit. Deeply, we all know what's
harming us, but we have an incredible ability to make the most obviously
harmful things seem like they're good for us.
