Title: A Note on Guidance Councillors
Tags: forty-eight

As someone not originally from Canada, many things stood out to me as a child.
One of those things was the lack of pressure that adults place on kids. There
is a belief here that we are all born unequal, and as a result, some are left
to fall by the wayside as the spotlight begins to shine on little prodigies.



From the minute I stepped foot onto Canadian soil I was looked at as someone
who would never shine under this spotlight, with an inability to keep up with
the rest, perhaps due to my foreign tendencies. Later on, my grade school
teachers did not see it fit that I enter the "Academic" tier in high school,
but rather the "Applied" tier as they saw me as an individual lacking in
academic discipline (for those unaware of the tier system in Canada; you are
placed in either the Academic, Applied, or Essential learning stream in high
school, which will then determine whether you enter university, college or
perhaps go straight into the workforce).



I knew from the very first day of high school that I was better than this, and
so began my journey to become a successful university student. Along the way
through this journey I would ask my councillor for guidance (as their job
entails). In retrospect, what she offered was not guidance, but rather the
roadmap to a life of complacency.



One thing to note is that sometimes a child may have unrealistic dreams. What
councillors tend to do, from my own experience at least, is they over estimate
the amount of children with unrealistic expectations. I was always level
headed and knew very well what my abilities were, which provided me with
sufficient evidence to say that some guidance councillors simply don't believe
in their pupils.



I'm also not saying that university is what everyone should be aiming for.
Heck no! The jobs one can attain from college are just as intriguing in their
own right, with the added benefit of lucrative starting salaries, but with
less debt compared to university. The problem is simply that as kids, we are
always told to forget our true ambitions and instead listen to adults _for
they know what is best for us_.



I wonder how many eager and bright children's dreams were brushed aside as
guidance councillors told them that they were not capable of doing what they
wanted to do. "This may not be the best thing for you", "College would better
suit you", are some of the demeaning comments that I would hear. It's sad to
see a system like this that encourages people to settle for what they can
currently do instead of teaching them that they can become a better individual
through hard work and determination.



My international friends also shared this same experience when coming to
Canada. Perhaps not with councillors, but we've all noticed how accepting of
mediocrity the school system is here. I'm not saying that guidance councillors
should be banished, but they should start believing in the kids instead of
lighting the way to the road most travelled ([as opposed to the road not
taken](http://www.bartleby.com/119/1.html)).



Not listening to my guidance councillor was the best decision I ever made.
