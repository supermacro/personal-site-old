Title: One of My Idols
Tags: posts

Someone who has inspired me to become the best possible me is Emerson Spartz.
The guy's simply unbelievable and was destined for greatness from the very
beginning.



Born in Indiana to a well-off family, he convinced his parents at the age of
twelve to let him drop out of school in order to homeschool himself. Spartz
then followed a strict curriculum which consisted of memorization techniques,
mnemonics, and other methods to cement information. His parents supplemented
his learning by having him read four short biographies of successful people
each day.

He learned how to speed read from a young age and eventually got to the point
where he was able to read one non-fiction book each day.



At the age of 27, he's the CEO of Spartz Media and one of the forefathers of
turning virality into a science. Truly a hero.
