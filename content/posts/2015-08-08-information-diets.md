Title: Information Diets
Tags: posts

A nutritional diet leads to a healthy and vigorous body & mind. It is one's
own responsibility to maintain a good eating regimen so as to sustain the
demands of the body and prolong its healthy state. There is a lot of conscious
effort that goes into doing this; you avoid temptations and sacrifice your
favourite meals in place of nutritional snacks. All this is done with long
term goals in mind.



Shouldn't this same ideology apply to our mindsets?



I believe it's one's own responsibility to ensure a healthy mind full of
amazing and healthy thoughts. Like I mentioned before, [your mind is an
input/output machine]({filename}2015-3-31-Your-Mind-Is-An-Input--Output-
Machine ).





Once at a certain age, you don't depend on your elders to continue feeding
you. So why would still depend on others to educate you and tell you what to
think. If you care about your mind and its potential, then it's advisable that
you start taking responsibility for it.



Much like a strict diet with short term pains and long term gains, the same
applies to feeding your mind with the proper information. It's definitely not
easy, but once you build momentum, the habit becomes self sustaining.
