Title: War's Broken Window
Tags: forty-eight

One of the most basic concepts in economics is the [Broken Window
Fallacy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erJEaFpS9ls).



The idea behind this notion is as follows:



Suppose we have a shop keeper that had money stored in a bank account. One
day, a delinquent comes by to disrupt the neighborhood when suddenly the shop
keeper hears a loud bang within his premise. It seems as though a window has
been smashed.



Subsequently a dismayed shopkeeper walks out to to meet a gathered crowd.



A man approaches him to console the man with the following bit of wisdom,
"although you have suffered a loss, our community will now gain thanks to the
outpouring of dollars into our economy."



The wise man is referring to the fact that the Shop Keeper's stored cash will
be used in some productive way. Now, with the employment of a handyman, (who
then buys tools to fix the window from a hardware store, which is prompted to
order raw materials to produce the hardware) the economy is stimulated.



As reasonable as this theory may sound. The economy is actually worse off by
the dollar amount that the Shop Keeper must dish out. This is because the Shop
Keeper could have utilized this money in the future for something other than a
window, which he previously had, in order to increase productivity in the
economy. In simpler terms, the economy is back to where it started at a cost
of the repairs.



With this concept in mind, lets turn our attention to the many broken windows
that war creates.



[Nearly two trillion dollars are spent on
war](http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending), of which
40% of such spending is made up by the United States. Patriotism and candid
speeches spur emotion amongst the public in order to enlist soldiers. What
these speeches always omit is [how much profit is made in times of
war](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.pdf). It's no surprise
then that war rages on almost all the time. The media helps stir emotion and
even justifies this destruction by stating how beneficial it is. For instance,
the economist Paul Krugman is renown for rationalizing war and it's ill-
perceived notions of economic value creation ([here he is talking about the
benefits that 9/11 had on the
economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/14/opinion/reckonings-after-the-
horror.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm)).



We can apply the principle of the Broken Window Fallacy to see how flawed Paul
Krugman's notions are. He, and other economists of the same view, only
acknowledge what is seen: The millions of dollars forcibly poured into the
economy as a result of deathly eradication. What isn't seen (as was the case
with the shop keeper who may have spent his money on a brand new suit or
something more productive than repairs) is the reallocation of funds towards
an unproductive agenda. The money could have been used instead on things such
as the advancement of human knowledge via research grants, or the reduction in
federal debt, which is much needed in all nations.



Instead, and thanks to propaganda, we continue to support the destruction of
nations in pursuit of global "democratization and equity" with the naivete to
believe that war actually contains some sort of good in it.
