Title: Renovations Almost Complete
Tags: posts



I've been working on a few things all at once so progression on everything
hasn't been as quick as I had hoped. Like I mentioned on [this
post](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/page3/), I wanted to learn something new and
was not happy with the slow latency of my blog so I decided to switch over
from Wordpress to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages.



### git + python + blogging practice



The whole process of moving the site was awesome experience in programming and
software management. I got good practice playing around with git as well as
got to create a script that organized the XML output from a WordPress export
into jekyll-ready content. [Here's](https://github.com/gDelgado14/soup) the
repository if you're interested in how I did it (caveat: it is far from
perfect but it did however get the job done for me). I'll write a more
detailed post this coming week as to how the script came about.



### TO-DO



\- Fix broken links on [Forty Eight](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/forty-eight/).
My python script may be able to solve this issue.

\- Fix Navbar

\- Maybe add search feature

\- Link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/gDelgado14)
