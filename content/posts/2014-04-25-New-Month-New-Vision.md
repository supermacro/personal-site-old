Title: New Month, New Vision
Tags: forty-eight

With my four month internship coming to an end, I have begun to rethink my
priorities as well as my goals.



As April ends and May begins I will return to school to complete my third year
of university. The combination of having a full course load, the ambition to
undertake a personal venture, and the hope of redesigning my life in the aim
of greater productivity all means that I will not have the time to write every
other day like I have done for these past few months.



I've also felt like writing under an outlet with my name on it has emanated an
essence of narcissism, hence why I haven't cared to market this website
extensively. The enjoyment came strictly from knowing that I'm meeting the
requirements of the goals I set out - mainly, to write something meaningful
about anything every other day. As such, this website has been less of a blog
and more of an exercise in discipline and creativity, and I've got to say that
it was a challenging undertaking while it lasted.



Additionally, I believe that if you are someone who knows me personally,
you'll instill a bias in whatever it is that I'm writing whether you like me
or not. As the manifesto within the renown [Zero
Hedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/) beautifully states:

> ... we believe in the critical importance of anonymity and its role in
dissident speech. like the economist magazine, we also believe that keeping
authorship anonymous moves the focus of discussion to the content of speech
and away from the speaker- as it should be. we believe not only that you
should be comfortable with anonymous speech in such an environment, but that
you should be suspicious of any speech that isn't.

If you've been been suspicious of my public writing, as you so rightfully
deserve to be, I commend you.



With all that said, I don't intend on extinguishing the burning desire to
write altogether, I only wish to lessen its extent on my life for the time
being. As of May, my writing will move to OnceAMonth, a venture by a [good
friend of mine](http://jrdnbshp.com/), with the intention of strengthening
relationships amongst those who care to stay in touch with me.



I'll delve into the details as May 1 approaches.
