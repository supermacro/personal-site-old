Title: Survivorship Bias and Other Cool Stuff
Tags: posts

I got into a discussion with a family member about the usefulness of
university and whether it's a worthwhile investment. This family member's
argument was that some of the most successful people out there dropped out of
university, thus providing this person with what he thought was evidence for
disproving a university education's effectiveness. However, one must look
beneath the surface and realize two concepts: Survivorship Bias, and the
10,000 hour rule, which, in combination, dispel my family member's hypothesis.

**Survivorship Bias**

This is a common statistical human misjudgement. We often assume that because
something (a company) or someone (in this case Bill Gates) succeeded in an
extraordinary fashion, then the case must be so every time. What we fail to
realize is all the _sunken ships_ that didn't make it to the light of day, and
as such are not publicized. Think of how many people were naive enough to
believe that they could become successful without first attaining a bachelors
or a diploma and leave what is essentially a hub for innovation and
networking. Not only are those that drop out without credentials, they are
competing against people with significantly more experience than they have in
a highly competitive market.

**The 10,000 Hour Rule**

In one of my favourite books,
**[Outliers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316017930&linkCode=as2&tag=gladwellcom
"Outliers")** , Malcolm Gladwell goes on to speak in one of the chapters about
the 10,000 hour rule. He essentially proves that throughout history, people
have always begun with the same level of skill. The reason that some become
accomplished in different endeavours is because of the incredible amount of
time they devote towards a specific task.



Very rarely do you have true prodigies that are born with an innate talent
that permits them to skip practice or to have a solid grasp of a subject prior
to formally being introduced to it.



If we look back at Bill Gates; his abilities were by no means innate. Both his
mother and father were highly educated and had access to all the resources
that Bill required to succeed from the get-go, thus putting the soon-to-be
tech magnate at a significant advantage. Then he was placed at a prep school
that allowed him to skip math class in order to play around with one of the
only available computers in the nation. At which point, his fascination grew
alongside his network of techies (of which some were introduced to Bill within
Harvard prior to his flunking out), leading into the culmination of the great
blue chip now known as Microsoft.



So next time you're thinking about dropping out, think about these logical
flaws before making what may probably end up being a large regret.
