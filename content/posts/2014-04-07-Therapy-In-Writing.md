Title: Therapy In Writing
Tags: forty-eight

In retrospect, there was considerable doubt when I told myself that I'd write
a post every other day without skipping a beat, but the more I do it, the
easier it becomes. I've found this experiment to function in the same way any
challenging task works; you struggle at first but if you fight through the
learning curve and _commit_ to it, you'll be fine.



There have been posts where my initial intention was to write something quick,
but the interest in the topic leads me deeper into the internet's burrows in
search for supporting media. Even though the intention is to make the writing
aesthetic, I've simultaneously learned in the process. You and I both learn
equally as much by the end of the last sentence in each post.



Blogging has also been a great form of meditation. If you have never tried
writing in a consistent manner, I encourage you to do so. You don't have to go
to through the extent that I'm going through, you can simply join a website
like [Medium](https://medium.com/about/9e53ca408c48) that allows you to
express yourself publicly, or anonymously with the help of a pseudonym.



If what hinders you from writing is a belief that you're not interesting
enough or literate enough, throw away that mentality. We are all unique
individuals with a view on life different from those even closest to
ourselves. It simply takes some practice to extract those golden nuggets of
worldly experience to then share them with the rest of us.
