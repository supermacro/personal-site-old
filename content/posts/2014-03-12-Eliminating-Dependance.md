Title: Eliminating Dependance
Tags: forty-eight

One's own attachment and need for others to get things done on your behalf
couldn't be any more counterintuitive to the concept of productivity and
achievement. As children, our health and safety is solely determined by our
parents. This inevitability molds us into dependent beings. We then grow up
not having learned to rid ourselves of this unpleasing trait. And with
dependance comes laziness - the destroyer of all ambitions.



As an example, my internship requires that I work with Microsoft Excel every
day. There are a lot of processes that lack efficiency and could easily be
automated, which would then allow people such as myself to work on more
productive tasks. The problem is that everyone at the office lacks the time or
the requisite proficiency to undertake such a project. With barely any prior
knowledge in automation, I rid myself of the dependence on others by
automating procedures myself.



Eliminating dependance adds to your own professional value. You become a much-
needed commodity in very short supply. Not only do you become "in-demand", but
you've created a virtuous cycle that produces more and more productive
outcomes.  The tough part is getting the ball rolling. Fortunately however,
just like the laws of physics; once you get in motion, creative inertia will
allow you to maintain forward progression.



[All it takes to get the ball rolling is an initial commitment to say you've
had enough with mediocrity.](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/work-now-relax-
