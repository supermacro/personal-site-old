Title: Iatrogenesis
Tags: posts

I can't say that my Health Economics online course has been a pleasant
experience while working full time. It has, however, provided me with some
interesting insights.



One of the assignments in the course required that we write an essay on
anything that pertained to economics and Canadian health care. With this
freedom, I decided to talk about iatrogenesis - the preventable harm resulting
from medical treatment or advice to patients. Professionals who may sometimes
cause harm to patients are: physicians; pharmacists; nurses; dentists,
psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Iatrogenesis can also result
from complementary and alternative medicine treatments.



Upon further research, I realized that the health care industry is one of the
[leading causes of death and injury within Canada and the United
States](http://www.whale.to/a/null9.html). It makes sense though, as strong as
a doctor's desire to help those with ailments, the market forces push the
health care industry to strive for profits before anything else.



In a health system like that of Canada's, known as a fee-for-service
structure, where doctors are paid on the quantity of their service (i.e. the
more patient visits the greater the income) rather than their quality of
service, doctors have the incentive to provide a level of health services
beyond what is required to a person, which then causes injury.



What I found most striking during my research was this little quote, "About
90% of patients who visit doctors have conditions that will either improve on
their own or are out of reach of modern medicine's ability to solve". With
this in mind and the fact that prescription meds always have steep
repercussions we can start seeing how more damage than good is done to us when
we step into a hospital.
