Title: Automation Is Nigh
Tags: posts

As I learn more about VBA programming, I can't help but think that at some
point in the near future life will be completely automated. So much so that
humanity may be at the cusp of either reaching a new frontier or crossing the
line in morality.



As a child, I have fond memories of imagining a technologically advanced
future. I remember looking at cell phones and thinking how awesome it would be
if [a watch could have the same functionalities](http://moto360.motorola.com/)
while maintaining the alluring appeal of a timepiece. History has shown time
and time again that society's wildest imaginations often come to fruition. As
beautiful and promising as that may sound, not all of tomorrow's innovations
will bring forth a brighter future.



My fear is that our personalities and culture will slowly diminish as
technology continues to get smarter and smarter. Just look at how less social
we've become in many instances; you can just sense the deterrence in people's
desire to spark up a conversation with strangers because we're all connected
to our iPods and are simultaneously texting someone else.

Before watching "Her" I naively believed that I was the only one who'd
envisioned a future where digital significant-others could be purchased.
What's most bewildering with this idea is that it's [already happening in
Japan](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24614830) and most probably other
parts of the world as well.



And if for one second you doubt the idea of a digital friend full of love,
hate, and the entire spectrum of human emotion, [then listen to
this](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/ideas/ideas_20140215-2102a.mp3)
(Henry Markram on his endeavor to create a digital brain)



If you don't think you're affected by life's current state of digitization,
think again. Our [brains have already been impacted
gravely](http://mashable.com/2012/04/10/brain-internet-infographic/) with the
advent of the World Wide Web. Who knows how much will remain of our self
awareness once we start delegating all our thinking to artificial
intelligence.

Human nature has imbedded in us an incessant desire to simplify tasks. We seek
the path of least resistance and won't hesitate to have machines do our
thinking, but where do we stop? Will grave repercussions ensue once we create
conscious machines capable of learning at rates unbeknownst to man? Only time
will tell.
