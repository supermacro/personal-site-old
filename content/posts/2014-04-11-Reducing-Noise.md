Title: Reducing Noise
Tags: posts

I've slowly come to the realization that true innovative thought cannot come
until we've removed distractions from our lives, and living in an age where
things left, right, and center are begging for our attention can make it all
that difficult. Websites such as Facebook encourage us to divert our limited
attention span in search of social validation (face it, we all strategically
position ourselves online to look a certain way). This all accumulates into an
unproductive waste of time, and it may not be your fear, but I sure as hell
don't want to look back and wonder what my life could have been like if it
weren't for the tantalizing series of shows (or other distractions) that kept
me from pursuing my dreams.



Reducing this mindless consumption of information is pivotal in changing our
mindset from consumer to creator. What I suggest is to slowly reduce the
amount of mind numbing that you indulge in throughout the week. [In one of my
past articles](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/work-now-relax-later.html "Work Now,
Relax Later"), I discussed some solutions for reducing distractions. A problem
that arises with the mentioned solutions is that unless you are not fully
committed to your goal, then you'll find ways from which to divert yourself
away from productivity. You must be willing to suffer through the work at
hand, and perhaps instead of having someone ask you, "what is it that you
want?", you should ask yourself, "what is it that I'd unduly suffer for?".
Remember that nothing worth having comes easy.
