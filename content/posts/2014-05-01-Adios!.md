Title: Adios!
Tags: posts

With the month of April coming to an end, my internship wrapping up this
Friday, my second semester of third year beginning next week, and a whole
change in my schedule approaching, I think it is time I bid this website's
current structure farewell.



It has been a great experience having written a post every other day. I've
noticed considerable improvements in my writing ability, but as I flip the
page and move onto a new chapter in my life, so too must this story end.



This journal-blog will eventually transform into something else, only time
will tell what that something else ends up being.
