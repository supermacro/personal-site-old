Title: The Golden Rule
Tags: posts

Admittedly, last night's partying in downtown Toronto
([Pravda](http://www.pravdavodkabar.com/) was the location of choice, check it
out if you're ever in town) left me with an incomplete timeline of events. I
did, however, maintain full recollection of a good conversation I had.



Nothing revolutionary nor abstract, and so often repeated that the concept's
meaning usually dissipates before we even get a chance at digesting it. I
can't recall how we got started on this topic, but with the typical fluidity
of conversations we digressed towards the [Golden
Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), which is the amalgamation of
all religions' laws: Treat others the way you would like to be treated. It's
beautiful how simple, yet powerful, this idea is.



Akin to theories that seem fail-proof and obvious on paper ([for example the
"proven" theory that states that the used car market will cease to
exist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons)), the absence of
peace around the world would make it seem as though this notion has yet to
conjure up in the minds of billions. And I'll be the first to admit that even
for well-meaning individuals such as myself, we will inadvertently break the
Golden Rule here and there.



In the verbal carelessness induced by alcohol, a friend broke the concept down
into an even simpler statement - _don't be a cunt._
