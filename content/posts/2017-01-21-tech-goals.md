Title: Autodidact
Tags: entrepreneurship



As mentioned in my [last post](/2017/01/12/goals-values.html), I want to gain
a deeper understanding of Software and Technology in general. I never received
formal education in software engineering. Despite this, I'm currently the only
full-time engineer at [Homigo](http://www.homigo.com/). There's a lot of
responsibility here as one mistake could cost us a lot of money and a lot of
unhappy customers.



Beyond learning practical workplace skills, I'm also tickling my fancy, so to
speak. I find computer science to be a fascinating yet highly challenging
field that I'd like to learn more about.



As an entrepreneurial person, I also want to better equip myself for the next
technology company that I start.



I've developed a set of challenges and sub-goals for this year. I already know
I probably won't be able to achieve all of these things. After all, one of my
other goals is to prioritize my finite time. This means that sometimes other
equally-important things will prevent me from achieving one of these sub-
goals. As I mentioned previously, I hope to complete half of the following
items:



## Understand Networks



As a web developer I work every day with the interwebz. It's critical that I
understand what's happening under the hood so as to make informed
architectural decisions.



This challenge consists of:



\- Completing the [Networking for Web Devs](https://www.udacity.com/course
/networking-for-web-developers--ud256) course

\- Completing the [Client-Server
Communications](https://www.udacity.com/course/client-server-communication--
ud897) course





## Contribute to an Open Source Project



I have been slacking very hard on this front. One area in particular that I am
quite lazy in is reading other people's code. Contributing to an open source
project would help me learn from others who are much more skilled and
experienced than I am.



As of now, I am not sure which project I am going to contribute to. There are
so many. But in order for this challenge to be considered complete, my code
must be integrated into the codebase of the project.



From a quick search, I found [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/1/6
-beginner-open-source) article which has already given me some ideas on what
to contribute to.



As someone who works daily with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Grommet looks like super promising](https://grommet.github.io) project that
I'd be curious to learn more about. This might actually be the project I
choose to contribute to. I noticed they don't have an autocomplete component,
so this could be a component I design for this library.



## Actually Use my Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits



My love for technology is known to all. Because of this, I have been gifted
several [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) kits. These are some of the best gifts I've
ever gotten. The problem is, I've never taken the time to actually play around
with them.



So this year I resolve to change that.



## Redesign My Website



The goal of this is to improve my CSS skills and organize this website in a
better way.



One thing I currently don't like how I can't categorize posts and search for
specific topics.





## Understand Algorithms



> The prerequisite to this challenge is that I read about data structures



Algorithms are a core aspect of my job. But I lack the framework to think
about an algorithms efficiency. I know the basics, but I don't feel satisfied
knowing just the basics of this field. Proficiency in algorithm design and
analysis is one of the pillars that compose a good engineer.



There are a few online classes that Udacity, edX, and Coursera have. I'll
decide which to take once I feel ready to take the class.



## Read Some Great Books



You'll know I've read these books when I post my notes to them here.



#### Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja



This is the first book on my list, and one I've begun reading already.



#### Algorithms and Data Structures



There's a really good book offered for free online that I'd like to use as my
reference for learning Data Structures.



Its examples are written in Python, which is also a language that I'd like to
understand better.



#### High Performance Browser Networking



This is [the seminal book](hpbn.co) on networking for web developers. It goes
into great detail on what web devs should be aware of when working with the
web applications.





#### On JS Execution Context and Scope Chain



There is a [great 2-part series](http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-
execution-context-in-javascript/) on the JavaScript Execution Context and its
Scope Chain, which I find quite illuminating. This is must-know knowledge for
JS devs.



#### On Containerization



Containers are a great way to manage inconsistencies across various software
environments. They aren't the easiest things to understand at first, but with
a few articles I'm sure I'll be up to speed.





#### Code



[Charles Petzold's book](https://www.amazon.ca/Code-Language-Computer-
Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) looks quite interesting. He starts with the
basic building blocks of computing (binary data) to eventually creating a
computer.



#### Learn You A Haskell



I've wanted to learn a functional programming language and thought since
Haskell is so hipster, why not give it a shot. [The
book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is also meant for programmers who have
never tried functional programming.



#### The Imposter's Handbook



[This book](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) is
intended for people like me - devs in industry who did not receive formal
education in the field of computer science. It's meant to cover at a high
level the key concepts of the field.











## Wish List



These are resources I found online that I may one day read but am not actively
focused on doing so any time soon.
