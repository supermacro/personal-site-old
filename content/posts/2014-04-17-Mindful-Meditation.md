Title: Mindful Meditation
Tags: forty-eight

Meditation is something I definitely don't do enough of. On the odd occasion
in which I have given it an honest attempt, I always come out with a refreshed
mind. Being an active individual, this has also made me consider doing yoga,
which I may look into once the summer begins.



For people like me who have next to no experience in meditation, it is nearly
impossible to maintain an empty mind for [more than a few
seconds](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2379z8/i_have_real_bad_adhd_and_have_an_exceptionally/cgu65bw?context=3)
\- the attention deficit that has resulted from our high-information
generation. Thankfully, however, there is [a website that walks you
through](http://www.calm.com/) and helps you maintain zen for the duration of
the meditation. If it weren't for this site, I'd end up with a mind far from
empty (which is the goal in meditation), and thus ruin the whole exercise.
Finishing a cycle will give you vigor and clarity of mind to either start your
day, or diminish your day's accumulated stress.



I can't name off all the benefits since I personally have experience very
little, but I can say that I always feel energized, and with a mental clarity
that allows me to focus on what needs to be done, not to mention that stress
is completely abolished once you come back into consciousness.



[This article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/mindfulness-

to a greater extent, which I admittedly have yet to experience myself.
