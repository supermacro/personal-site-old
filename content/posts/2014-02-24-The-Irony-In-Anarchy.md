Title: The Irony In Anarchy
Tags: forty-eight

In my previous post about [Venezuela's current
condition](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/venezuela-needs-your-help.html "Venezuela
Needs Your Help"), I updated you on the matter currently at hand. I discussed
the fallout of peaceful protest into the breaking point between the Chavista
regime and the frustrated opposition, as well as the recent inundation of
Cuban forces.



I then left you with a quote essentially guilt tripping you into taking a
stance with the goal of having you share the news.



What I began thinking afterwards was that I didn't suggest an alternative. My
self-interests kicked in with the sole ambition of raising awareness - I just
want the corruption and violence to end. As to exactly how this tyranny should
end, I have no clue. You can't just hire a group of mercenaries to just kill
the leaders in Venezuela, they would just be replaced by the next men in the
pecking order. Hell, if the current president of Venezuela is an Ex-Bus
driver, there is very little stopping anyone else from taking over.



A coup by the people is nearly impossible as well since they are unarmed, and
fighting against an unhesitant and heavily armed force.



The irony in all this is that you, me, and everyone else long determined the
outcome of these events. Just like [a butterfly
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect), our actions since the
dawn of capitalism and free-market economics have created a world that
disregards empathy in the aim for corporate domination.



Consumers are the rulers in the world economy, and companies only seek to
serve whatever it is we demand. If you demand lower and lower prices with
increased quality, then it shall be so. But human nature doesn't look behind
the facade of a junior chicken and all of its negative connotations. Somewhere
in another part of the world some slave busted his ass for the iPhone you own.



And this disconnect between consumerism and the people who suffer as a
consequence is what breeds contempt in nations such as Ukraine, Thailand,
Venezuela, and the rest of the world. This enables corrupt politicians to
promise change, and thus lunatics like Castro, Chavez, and Yanukovych are
initially hailed as heroes, to the eventual surprise of the many, who realize
these leaders' ulterior motives.



Reasonably then, the only way to end global corruption is to either reduce our
consumption of products, or accept to pay a fair price for the goods we seem
to need so much*. Only then will the world prosper for a prolonged period.







_*You're already seeing this at locations like Starbucks or other coffee shops
that sell fair trade coffees at a premium. The benefit you get is that your
consumption of the product is now guilt-free._
