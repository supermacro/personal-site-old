Title: Listen To Tyler Durden

Tyler only speaks truths with this phrase, "The things you own end up owning
you". I'd like to believe that material possessions are a supplement to our
being, but more often than not we tend to place more importance on inanimate
objects as opposed to those things which bring to us the most value in life.



I recently listened to [Earl Nightingale's "The Strangest
Secret"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XofumNQMqA), and it he said something
that I couldn't agree with more:

> The problem is that our mind comes as standard equipment at birth. It's
free. And things that are given to us for nothing, we place little value on.
Things that we pay money for, we value.

Untrained human cognition takes for granted the things which we don't work
hard towards, we're just wired that way. With this in mind, then it makes
total sense that we throw away the most valuable things and place greater
importance on those things with monetary value.



Once you realize the toxicity and distraction that flows from materialism,
then you can begin to work towards something of value. Start placing more
importance on family, friends, and [inner] self.
