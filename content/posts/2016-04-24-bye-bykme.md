Title: Bye Bye BykMe
Tags: entrepreneurship



Back in the fall of 2014 I noticed that municipal bicycle sharing programs
were a huge financial burden. The cost of high tech bike racks, maintenance,
and balancing out bike fleets across a region oftentimes caused these bike
programs to [go out of business](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bye-
bye-bixi-retooled-bike-sharing-service-unveiled-today-1.2592459).



This insight came at a time where everyone was talking about the sharing
economy. Thus, it was only logical that we share our bicycles as well. So just
before the beginning of 2015, I decided that I would give entrepreneurship a
shot and focus on how to make bike sharing more sustainable.



It's now been just over a year. Even though BykMe never picked up, there were
several lessons learned that I'd like to share.



### The Media Is Not Your Userbase

I was very strategic about the branding of the service and made it seem much
bigger than it actually was from day one.



This lead to attention from the [local news](http://www.therecord.com/news-
story/5541408-wlu-student-launching-online-bicycle-brokerage/), a few bloggers
and even [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/bykme).



Simply because reporters, bloggers, and your friends say that the product or
idea is great doesn't mean it's actually great. As an entrepreneur, the only
thing that matters is the opinion of your users. More importantly, make sure
people are actually **willing to pay** for your product.



### Pick Your Team Wisely

I began working on this business on my own but was soon approached by two
people who had complimentary skillets. Unfortunately, they weren't as
passionate about BykMe as I was. Eventually it felt like they were my
employees and I was doing far more than they were to ensure the survival of
the business.



That's not to say that they're lazy. I respect them both and wish them all the
best. But the product/team fit just wasn't there.



Doing startups isn't for the faint of heart. You can't just work five days a
week and take weekends off. It has to be an obsession for the business to have
any chance of survival. My cofounders just didn't have the required internal
drive to see BykMe succeed.



In retrospect I should have gone at it alone until I saw a serious need for a
cofounder.



If you do want to have a cofounder on board, simply work together for a week
or two and see how the two of you get along. Look to see how proactive the
prospective cofounder is.



Also, [ideas](https://sivers.org/multiply) are worthless so there's no need
for anyone to sign an NDA at this stage. Executing on those ideas is what
matters.



### Transaction Costs Are Important

My revenue model was simple. Charge the bicycle owner 10% per transaction.



The [service](https://www.sharetribe.com/) I was using to host BykMe was using
PayPal, which charged an additional 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.



It was up to the owner and renter to agree on how the transaction would occur.
Would the renter go to the owner's house? Would they meet half way? And what
happened at the end of the rental period?



The 12.9% + $0.30 cost plus the mental work of having to figure out how the
exchange would actually work made it a tough sell for bicycle owners. Security
was also a big issue for bike owners as well. This was when I realized I
needed some sort of hardware to monitor the bicycle.



On the renter side, I knew there was a bit of a problem when I had to list my
own bike for a dollar **and** take it to their location to get people to start
using the service.



### Key Partnership Dissolved

I had the pleasure of working alongside a very smart group of University of
Waterloo engineers throughout this experience. They were working on a smart
bicycle lock called Grasp that would enable users to unlock the device with
their fingerprints or their phones.

The idea was that BykMe would use their locks to make transactions much easier
for my users. A bicycle owner could now get information on where the bike is
and also grant access to the bike remotely through a mobile application.



Long story short; disruptive hardware is incredibly difficult to produce. Much
harder than software. Especially if the hardware is as unique as a smart
bicycle lock with biometric and bluetooth sensors. You need a lot of cash to
design the device in such a way as to get the benefits of [economies of
scale](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp) while
ensuring the product performs as intended. The team simply didn't have the
runway to do this.



*This experience confirmed my belief that it's much easier to start a software company than a hardware company*. 



With this partnership hanging on by a thread, I was struggling to figure out
how to make the BykMe user experience secure and seamless. I was adamant that
hardware similar to that of Grasp was essential for BykMe to succeed.



By the Fall of 2015, there were two additional bicycle sharing companies. This
made me realize how quickly the tech ecosystem evolves.



### Listen To Your Users

I simply didn't listen to the feedback that current and potential users had. I
thought I knew where the errors lied. But had I listened, perhaps this
business could still be kicking.



For future endeavours I intend to fervently listen to what my customers have
to say. I don't mean to say that they have all the answers ([customers don't
know what they want](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-customers-dont-
know-what-they-want-until-weve-shown-them-as-Steve-Jobs-said)), but they are
certainly a guiding light in the right direction.
