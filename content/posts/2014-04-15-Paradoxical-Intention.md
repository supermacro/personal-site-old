Title: Paradoxical Intention
Tags: forty-eight

Some of the articles I've written here speak on a broader level; focusing on
the main tenets rather than the steps to reach the end point in areas such as
[productivity](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/delimit-yourself/ "Unlimit Yourself").



To fill that gap, I'd like to talk about [paradoxical
intention](http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/sleepdisorderstreatment/f/What-
Is-Paradoxical-Intention.htm), a strategy to conquer phobias, which prevent
you from moving into higher plateaus in betterment.



The goal in paradoxical intention is to fully embrace whatever it is that's
hindering you from improvement. For instance, if you are a chronic
procrastinator, then a psychologist might prescribe paradoxical intention
through full immersion into the deepest state of procrastination you've ever
experienced (for a short period of time, perhaps a day). The twist is that you
do this in a conscious mindset, and in the total awareness of your destructive
actions you might come to the realization that you are numbing your capacity
to think creatively.



If you are truly committed to overcoming some psychological hurdle, here lies
another tool, albeit somewhat extreme, that could aid in your quest for
advancement.
