Title: Hello, Again
Tags: entrepreneurship



Time has flown by this summer.



In fact, it has been so long that I feel like I've lost my blogging mojo. I am
on a quest to get it back. Back when I did my [forty-eight](/forty-eight/)
hour project, my brain was firing at full speed. I want that feeling back
again.



This blog entry is simply an exercise in warming up once more to the habit of
consistent blogging. A habit I can't recommend highly enough.



Expect good quality content to come from me soon. Mind you I've got a lot on
my plate at the moment, although I'd prefer to keep it on the down low for the
time being.



This website will also be receiving a long-overdue makeover. I'm sorely
lacking in CSS abilities. As such, I plan on implementing all of the CSS
myself.



Well, that's it for now, folks.
