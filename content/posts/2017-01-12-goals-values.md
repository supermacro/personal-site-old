Title: Values & Goals
Tags: habits



As mentioned in my [last post](/2017/01/07/review.html), I'd like to outline a
rough overview of my values and goals for this year.



## Values for 2017



As [imperfect] humans, we oscillate in and out of our ideal selfs. We
experience pride in having done the "right thing", and at other times we
experience regret at having done actions that oppose our morals.



Here are the values I want to adhere by this year:





#### Presence



I struggle to be in the moment. I'm quite often in my head and not fully
"there". My lack of presence diminishes the value of every moment. I will work
deliberately to be more present in 2017.





#### Patience



For whatever reason, I'm inclined to want things now and tend to lose my
patience quite quickly. I must work to be more patient this year. Good things
come to those who wait.





#### Discipline



Discipline is a crucial component for achieving tough goals. I consider myself
somewhat disciplined, but if I am to reach my theoretical peak mental
performance then I must crank my discipline up a few notches.



Discipline means doing the things you need to do at the expense of the things
you want to do.





#### Good Health



I've always been quite active and had a natural inclination to eat relatively
healthy. Despite my natural tendencies I have to improve my health (both
mentally and physically) from its current state because my lifestyle requires
it.



My body is always tight and soar due to my past life as a high-level soccer
player. As such I must ensure that I manage my injuries & contusions to
prevent further problems down the road.



Being the short-fused and anxious guy that I am, I must also improve my mental
health by way of extending my metaphorical fuse and ridding myself of my
anxious tendencies.





#### Vulnerability



I am naturally reserved. I keep to myself and seem to have a difficult time
opening up to people.



I believe there is a better way to live life. I should be open and honest, and
not hide who I am to anyone, regardless of who they are. This is a willingness
to be vulnerable and an attitude of selfless giving as opposed to a shielded
attitude of fear and anxiousness.



Being more open and honest, even if brutally so, is a key component of this
value.



This requires that I let go of my preoccupation with others' perceptions of
me.





#### Independence



A want to do things for myself and not have to depend on others. Treat myself
to things I like. Be kind to myself. Self indulgence is OK to a sane degree.



Less focus on others.



More independent thinking. Less time spent on the echo chamber that is social
media.



\---



My ambition is to be my ideal self as often as possible, which means sternly
adhering to the above values.







## Desired Goals for 2017



Here are some of the concrete results I want to attain and habits I want to
create this year:



#### meditate meditate meditate



Every time I get into the habit of meditation, I feel incredibly at peace,
calm, and more energetic. Then for one reason or another I invariably break
the habit. This year I want to make sure I cement meditation as part of my
lifestyle for the rest of my life.



Even if you don't believe in any of the mysticism associated with meditation,
it has been
[scientifically](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/02/09/7-ways-
meditation-can-actually-change-the-brain/#69a1a8a27023) proven to benefit you.
So I encourage you to try it this year as well! [Tara
Brach](https://www.tarabrach.com/) has some amazing guided meditations. And if
you want to learn more about meditation, [this](https://www.amazon.com
/Wherever-You-Go-There-
Are/dp/1401307787/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1484221541&sr;=8-1&keywords;=wherever+you+go+there+you+are)
is a great book to get you started.



*My goal is to meditate at least once a day five times a week.*





#### Have clearly defined priorities



Social media, and in my case [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com),
creates a great sense of FOMO. These websites make me feel like I need to keep
up with the latest software trends. As such I get overwhelmed when I realize
there isn't enough time to learn and do all of the things I find online.



This year I want to have well-defined priorities to navigate through all the
enticing noise the internet throws at me. I'll have a blog post that will go
deeper into my framework.



> "A lack of time is a lack of prioritiesa" - Tim Ferriss



*My goal is to better allocate my finite time to the things I value most*





#### Be a Better Friend



As an introvert I tend to spend a lot of time alone even though I have many
friends and family who care about me. My lack of communication with these
people sometimes distances them and dilutes the relationship. I am a caring
person and I want to show that this year.



*My goal is to keep in touch more regularly with friends and family*





#### Become a Technological Minimalist



Much like Cal Newport mentions in his [blog
post](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/18/on-digital-minimalism/), I am both
in love and disheartened by technology. On the one hand I see very clearly how
it can help humanity overcome its current problems and bring more peace to
society. On the other, some of its uses are sucking the life right out of us.
Facebook has been shown to induce envy, egotism, depression, and other not-so-
fun feelings. The NSA's (& GCHQ, etc.) overreaching power is threatening free
speech, creating the obedient and docile society any tyrannical power would
dream of. We have to be conscious to use the tools that really do benefit us
rather than strive to [push away
boredom](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102881562226/creativity) from our lives.



"Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital
communication tools (and behaviours surrounding these tools) add the most
value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and
aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of
the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life." - [The
Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com/)

> In the movie Wall-E, people are depicted as no longer needing to walk due to
hover chairs being invented. This leads the human species' bone structure to
change, making it impossible for them to do anything more than make awkward
steps in search of their hover chairs. Obesity and incessant distractions are
the norm. The notion of [critical, independent] thinking is a thing of the
past.



A problem with the unfiltered use of consumer-facing technology is that most
of it is designed to keep you using it for as long as possible. Our attention
span is these companies' money maker. It's also *your* money maker. Protect it
aggressively.



*My goal is to use only the technologies, platforms, and tools that provide the greatest value to my life*





#### Make Blogging a Habit (Again)



I cannot emphasize how beneficial blogging is. Even if nobody reads your blog,
it helps you in so many ways beyond just branding. Your writing skills
improve. Your creativity improves. Your focus improves. The list goes on.



*My goal is to post an entry once a week*





#### Work Out Weekly



I've always been in decent shape, but not so much because I work out often but
because I'll sporadically do health-related things such as bike to work or go
to a park to play soccer for a bit.



*My goal is to abide by a workout schedule that I'll stick to this year*



#### Optimize My Sleep Cycle



I'd like to wake up earlier in the mornings. I find I am most productive
during this time of day, but I struggle to get out of bed.



*My goal is to wake up at or before 5:30am at least 100 days*



#### Gain a Deeper Understanding of Software and Technology



Considering my current job requires me to code almost all day, it would be a
prudent investment to better understand the technologies I work with and
depend on.



Improving my understanding of technology is also a good investment in my human
capital, and a good asset to have whether I'm looking to start a company with
someone or attain a new job.



*My goal is to complete at least half of the challenges I give myself in this domain*



> I will post on my blog the list of articles / books / lectures / resources I
intend to consume





#### Live a more balanced life



I possess a bit of an obsessive personality. When I want to do something, I go
all-in 100%. This is great from a get-things-done perspective, but awfully bad
when it comes to having a balanced lifestyle.



I can't say I value a balanced lifestyle much. But I do know that my current
lifestyle is a bit too extreme in some aspects.



*My goal is to do things I wouldn't usually do, like go to a comedy festival or learn how to dance salsa*





\---



This is still a rough idea of my goals. Not much has been said about how
they'll actually be accomplished. I found a great article called [8760
Hours](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/) that I'm using as the framework to
plan out my goals and values for this year. In it I'll discuss some of the
details of my self-improvement plan for 2017.



See you next post!
