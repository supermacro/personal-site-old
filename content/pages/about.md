Title: About

Hi 👋! My name's Giorgio as you probably already noticed, but a lot of people call me Gio.

I studied Economics, but dropped out in my final year to start my own software company. I ended up participating in the [Next 36 program](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/) in 2016 and haven't looked back since. Although my company didn't succeed, I came out of the experience learning A LOT, and knowing that software is where I see myself long term.

From 2016 - 2020, I worked at a lovely company called [Setter](https://setter.com/) as a full stack engineer. I can't recommend enough to young, unencumbered, folks to join startups. 

Now I'm taking some time to launch a little app of mine, called ParlezVous, as well as work on some open source projects that I maintain.

> Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark, "Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think," surprise you? - [Richard Hamming](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004020)
